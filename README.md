* **Method 2:** Git

To create clone ***your forked repository*** on your local machine, run this command inside your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/python-mini-project.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.
> 
‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

### 4. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Set it up
* **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more about how to clone the remote respository on your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#cloning-a-repository).

* **Method 2:** Git

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/python-mini-project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/python-mini-project.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original [Python mini project](https://github.com/nduongthucanh/python-mini-project/) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/srimani-programmer/Breast-Cancer-Predictor.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

---

### 5. ‚ôªÔ∏è Sync it 

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, follow the following steps:

* **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more about how to fetch and pull origin from/to your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch).

* **Method 2:** Git

Run the following commands ***carefully*** to update your local repository

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `New_Pipeline` branch
$ git checkout New_Pipeline

# Reset local `main` branch to match the `upstream` repository's `main` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/main

# Push changes to your forked `Breast-Cancer-Predictor` repo
$ git push -u origin New_Pipeline
```

- Create a folder in
  [projects directory](https://github.com/nduongthucanh/python-mini-project) according to issue name.
- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the
   [README_TEMPLATE.](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md)

* **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop
